# The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

This repo contains a WIP decompilation of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (GCN USA).

It builds the following DOL:

main.dol - `sha1: 4997D93B9692620C40E90374A0F1DBF0E4889395`

And will eventually build all the [RELs](./docs/rels_sha1.md).

## Windows Prerequisites

1. Download and run the latest release of the [Windows devkitpro installer](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases)
2. Run the executable located at `devkitPro\msys2\msys2.exe`
3. Update pacman by running the following command: `pacman -Syu`
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command: `pacman -S python3-pip base-devel gcc vim cmake`
5. Change to the directory of where you cloned this repository
6. Install the required python dependencies with `python3 -mpip install -r tools/requirements.txt`

## Build Instructions

1. Obtain a clean DOL of TP (GCN USA) and place it at the root of the repo and name it `baserom.dol`.
2. Obtain a copy of the MWCC PowerPC compiler (version 2.7 to be exact). See below for a link to our Discord server which has the CodeWarrior compilers pinned in the #tp-decomp channel.
3. Replace `tools/mwcc_compiler/2.7/mwcceppc.exe` with the custom one also pinned in the #tp-decomp channel.
4. Run `make` at the root of the repo.

## Dump Assets

1. Place a vanilla copy of the NTSC-U version at the root of the folder and call it `gz2e01.iso`.
2. Make the game directory.

```bash
mkdir game
```

3. Run make assets.

```bash
make assets
````
